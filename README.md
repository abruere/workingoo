## Getting started

You first need to get your Stelace API Keys. Good news: [it’s free](https://stelace.com/pricing).

> Note: this template uses advanced features available in _Business_ plans or higher, such as Organizations.

1. Clone this repository (replace with your fork URL)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stelace/jobs-marketplace-template.git
cd jobs-marketplace-template
```

2. Install node_modules

```sh
# using yarn instead of npm is recommended
yarn
```

> If you don’t have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed, you can follow these [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install).

3. Create environment files for development and production.

You can copy `.env.example` and fill it with Stelace API keys.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.development
# You may want to use live keys in this file
cp .env.example .env.production
```

You need to fill the following environment variables:

- STELACE_INSTANT_WEBSITE_URL
- STELACE_*PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY (pubk_*...) used in Vue app
- STELACE_*SECRET_API_KEY (seck_*...) used in data seeding scripts

4. Start the development server

```sh
yarn dev
# same as
quasar dev
```

Please refer to [Quasar docs](https://v1.quasar-framework.org/) for more details about configuration and info on components.

5. Seed development [data](./docs/development-data.md)

```sh
yarn seed
```

## Deployment

We’ve set up continuous deployment with Netlify.

### Branches for continuous deployment

- `dev` for development and _test_ environment, including pending PRs deployed to [Netlify preview subdomains](
  https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#branches-deploys)
- `workingoo` for _live_ environment, automatically deployed after any commit on this branch
- __`master` is used to pull changes from `upstream/jobs`__, and must be kept in exact sync with no local change.

Usual sequence of commands:

```sh
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/jobs
git checkout dev
# Resolve any conflict
git merge master
# Check everything is ok on staging website (Netlify CD)
git push
# Deploy live
git checkout workingoo
git merge dev
git push
```
